# Real-time-Object-Detection-with-YOLO-and-Webcam

To begin, youâ€™ll need to set up your environment. We need a Python environment with OpenCV

```
$ pip install opencv-python

```
you'll also need to install the ultralytics library that makes working with YOLO very easy and hassle-free.

```
$ pip install ultralytics
```
